## Project Pitch

### The Basic Story of the Application

### The Core Features of the MVP

### The API Data and How It Will Be Used

The API used will be [Picsum](https://picsum.photos). It will be used to grab a random image for the user.

### Expected Challenges

Using CSS to effectively style

### How the Project Requirements Are Being Met

*Your app must be a HTML/CSS/JS frontend that accesses data from a public API. All interactions between the client and the API should be handled asynchronously and use JSON as the communication format.*



*Your entire app must run on a single page. There should be NO redirects. In other words, your project will contain a single HTML file.*

*Your app needs to incorporate at least 3 separate event listeners (DOMContentLoaded, click, change, submit, etc).*

At a minimum:
- DOMContentLoaded will be used to render the first random photo in the form
- A submit event will be used to add a translation to the list
- A click event will be used to upvote/downvote a translation

*Some interactivity is required. This could be as simple as adding a "like" button or adding comments. These interactions do not need to persist after reloading the page.*

*Follow good coding practices. Keep your code DRY (Do not repeat yourself) by utilizing functions to abstract repetitive code.*
