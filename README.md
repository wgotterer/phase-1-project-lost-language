Lost Languages is an application to help people practice learning new languages. By using the [Lorem Picsum](https://picsum.photos) API, a random image is grabbed and displayed on the page. The user can then come up with a sentence to describe the image and attempt to translate it. Once submitted, other users can vote on whether the translation is accurate or not, and even add their own translation to the same image.

To use this application, a local server with access to `db.json` must be running.

## The Core Features of the MVP

- As a user I should be able to navigate to the page and generate a random image.   
- As a user I should be able to add sentences to the image.   
- As a user I should be able to like/dislike the translations.

## Ideas for Future Development

- Implement a second API to provide automatic translations
- Provide options for users to filter the list of translations they see by language
